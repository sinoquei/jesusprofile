                    <p>
                        My coding journey began a few months before the start of the pandemic. At the time I believed to
                        be more interested in UX design. I am a creative minded person and I appreciate a good looking
                        products in various industries, so it seemed fitting. After doing some precourse work for a
                        bootcamp, I ended up getting frustrated with my lack of skills while using figma and made up my
                        mind that this was not the route for me. My confidence was had not developed enough to tackle a
                        job in tech. I headed into a very frustrated time in my life, heightened by the impending doom
                        we were all thrusted into during 2020. After many dead end jobs, both remote and in-person, I
                        decided to research web developement one more time. I came across a simple website building
                        tutorial, and this time, I did not run away. In fact, I ran towards web development head on.
                        There was something about what I was learning that just made sense. To further my education, I
                        researched bootcamps around my area and online. I came across Nucamp and was drawn to its
                        affordability and part time structure and decided to take the fundamentals course to learn more
                        HTML, CSS, and javascript. Javascript proved to be daunting, but I found the concepts clicking
                        in my head one after the other and now I can say I have a fair grasp in the language. I begin
                        the fullstack program in a few weeks and will graduate in October 2022. I no longer feel the
                        need to give up, instead I'm learning to let go of the doubt and dive into the world of
                        development head first.
